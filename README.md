# aniApi - Anime songbook

Hello Netwire!
I really love animes and this test was one of the coolest projects that develeped

This project is for the test of the junior developer job vacancy and consuming de AniApi, I developed an Anime SongBook.
It is basically a Anime music aggregator that you can search by name, artist, year.

------------

To run this application in your computer, you'll need some to install NodeJS and Yarn globally in your computer. Them run the following command:

<code>yarn</code> or <code>yarn install</code>

Them start the application:

<code>yarn run dev</code>

------------

This is the routes you can use by tests and consume de API:

Get all songs -> /songs <br>
Get song by Id -> /songs/:id <br>
Get song by anime Id -> /songs/anime/:id <br>
Get song by title -> /songs/title/:title <br>
Get song by artist -> /songs/artist/:artist <br>
Get song by Year -> /songs/year/:year <br>

Unfortunaly, I had no time to develop a frontend UI but I hope you like the project.
